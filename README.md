### FusionFi: Crypto Collateralised Fiat Loans

FusionFi is a lending platform that enables Cardano community members to borrow Fiat
currency against their crypto assets.

Although we initially focused explicitly on crypto/fiat, we are now in hte process of
expanding to enable crypto lending as well with our latest validators (V3).

These validators make use of several novel design patterns that allow us to manage both
of these key features, using modular and upgradeable validation mechanisms to achieve
this goal.

Our front end development is currently using V1 on cardano, only Fiat lending, however 
we are in the final stages of developing the crypto lending validators, ready to integrate
into the frontend.

// Please refer to `README.md` in `ccf-loans-onchain` for validator details and tests
